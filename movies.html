                    <p class="review">
                        <strong>Review:</strong> Good Will Hunting" stands as a profound exploration of human potential and selfâ€‘discovery, transcending its initial premise to deliver a cinematic experience that is both deeply intimate and universally relevant.                    </p>

                    <h2>500 Days of Summer</h2>
                    <p><strong>Director:</strong> Marc Webb</p>
                    <p class="review">
                        <strong>Review:</strong> Not a normal love story, the film offers a novel perspective on the romantic comedy genre since it deviates from the standard storyline of a male meeting a lady, they become romantically involved, confront a challenge, and then getting married. Instead, the movie focuses on the difficulties and reality of relationships, emphasizing how they can be both compassionate and devastating.

                    <h2>Secret Life Of Walter Mitty</h2>
                    <p><strong>Director:</strong>Ben Stiller</p>
                    <p class="review">
                        <strong>Review:</strong>This has to be one of the most criminally underrated movie of all time. I know it has been said lots and lots of time now, but this movie gives you a different perspective every time you watch it. I have had the pleasure to watch this movie right from my younger days well into my adulthood and it has given me a new meaning each time.

                    <h2>Se7en</h2>
                    <p><strong>Director:</strong> David Fincher</p>
                    <p class="review">
                        <strong>Review:</strong> Se7en is a compelling and brilliant postmodern film noir. It is grim and disturbing but it is also very intelligent and daring. What I did love about Se7en especially is that it is incredibly stylish, beautiful dark cinematography and dazzling landscapes really do add to the atmosphere. Very little of the murders are shown but we are appalled and shocked by what we hear of them, the action is tense and the climax is shattering.

                    <h2>The Perks Of Being A Wallflower</h2>
                    <p><strong>Director:</strong> Stephen Chbosky</p>
                    <p class="review">
                        <strong>Review:</strong>This was an excellent, heartfelt movie that is filled with a story that's interesting from the very beginning & holds your attention til the final moments. Loveable realistic characters, high quality acting, family & friendship dynamics, not your usual predictable film that shares a story of teens where everything ends happily ever after. Unexpected twists & turns. I like how this movie handled tough topics that are often part of life during the high school years. **Trigger warning**
